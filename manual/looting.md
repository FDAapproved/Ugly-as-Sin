# Looting

## Settings

(See [Scarcity](./scarcity.md))

## Mechanics

This feature allows looting of items off monster corpses. To loot a body:

1. Select the fists / melee on weapon slot 1 (zero).
2. Crouch on or next to the body and look at it.
3. Hold the `Use` key.

Rummaging/pocket sounds will be heard. If any loot is available on the body (controlled by the loot factor slider in Scarcity settings), it will be tossed nearby for pickup.

Once all the possible loot has been found, a randomized flavortext will appear to indicated that the body cannot be looted any further.
