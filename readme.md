# Ugly as Sin

A mod for [Hideous Destructor](https://codeberg.org/mc776/HideousDestructor), adding various optional features and mechanics. Originally started as *HD-Scavenger* with a focus on longer-term "survival" features, but rapidly expanded into a general purpose enhancement mutator.

## Features

Features are typically implemented as toggleable modules with various customizable settings. Modules and features can sometimes be changed mid-game, but typically it's recommended to start a new game or change/restart the map in order to ensure that proper initialization happens.

* **Hunger** - Requires the player to eat and drink or suffer fatigue penalties.
* [**Scarcity**](./manual/scarcity.md) - Reduce the supplies available to the player by despawning and/or breaking up ammo and item spawns.
* [**Fragshard Reducer**](./manual/fragfactor.md) - Specifies chance for enemy-reviving fragshards to spawn.
* **Allied Marines** - Friendly marine reinforcements that randomly replace human-type corpses.
* **Advanced AI** - Extra monster behaviors, such as searching, wounding, and flashlights/lasers.
* [**Corpse Looting**](./manual/looting.md) - Human-type corpses can be searched for useful items.
* **Visual Weapons** - Changes Marines and Tangos sprites to reflect their current weapon.
* **Aim Swaying** - Extra inertia for player aiming, especially when fatigued.
* **Focus Zoom** - Slight zoom-in effect when focused or aiming and not moving or stunned.
* [**Laser/Flashlight**](./manual/laserlight.md) - A PEQ-style combination laser and flashlight module.
* **Death Fading** - Fades the player's vision to black on death, faster or slower depending on final damage received.
* [**Weapon Jamming**](./manual/jamming.md) - Adds *very* rare jams to the pistol, SMG, and Liberator (can be cleared by simply pressing the fire button again).
* [**Better Ammoboxes**](./manual/ammoboxes.md) - Simple lightweight reusable boxes that can be packed like magazines to reduce the bulk of loose ammunition significantly.
* **Weapon Sling** - Allows the player to "brace" their weapon anywhere, even while standing.
* **Flares/Glowsticks** - Simple disposable lightsources for marking rooms or wandering in darkness.
* **Respirator** - Rechargable emergency air tank for extended underwater excursions. Drains faster the more fatigued you are.
* **Enhanced Medical** - More detailed wound treatment options, including bleeding stabilization to complement bandaging, and the **Trauma Kit** item for treating old wounds manually without using the auto-suture gun.
* **YOLO mode** - EXPERIMENTAL, multiplayer-only mode where players can still be incapacitated but not killed, until all players are down. Enable with `UaS_YOLO true` in the console when launching a MP session.

More detailed documentation is in progress for all features and will be located in the `manual/` folder.

## Development and Download

*Ugly as Sin* is always under rapid development and typically targets the "bleeding edge" `main` branch of Hideous Destructor. Bugs may be reported here as Github Issues, on the ZDoom forums in the Ugly as Sin thread, or on the Hideous Destructor discord server.
